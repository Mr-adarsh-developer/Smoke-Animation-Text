# Smoke-Animation-Text
<p>Description:
This project creates a striking “smoke” animation effect applied to text using pure CSS (no JavaScript). The effect makes the text appear as if it’s dissolving into wispy smoke, giving a dramatic, cinematic feel—ideal for titles, headers or creative UI elements.

Key Features:

Uses CSS animations and pseudo-elements to simulate smoke movement around and through the letters.

Pure CSS implementation: minimal code, no external libraries required.

Fully customizable: change the text, font, colors, speed and smoke density to suit your design.

Lightweight and performant: works across modern browsers thanks to CSS transforms and opacity transitions.

Usage Instructions:

Clone or download the repository.

In the HTML file, replace the placeholder text (e.g. “A D A R S H”) with your own text.

In the CSS file, adjust the font-family, font-size, text-color and background as needed.

Modify the animation keyframes (duration, delay, smoke drift/opacity) to tailor the effect to your preference.

Open the index.html in a browser to preview. Deploy on any static web host for live use.

Why Use This Effect:

Adds an eye-catching, dynamic visual flair to titles or landing pages.

No reliance on images or heavy JavaScript — keeps the implementation simple and lightweight.

Easily adaptable for creative typography, branding intros, or UI components that need an atmospheric touch.

Potential Enhancements / Future Work:

Support responsive text sizes and mobile-friendly smoke effects.

Add interactive hover/scroll triggers (e.g. smoke intensifies when user hovers).

Provide multiple preset styles (e.g. “smoke swirl”, “fire + smoke”, “digital glitch smoke”).</p>
